-- Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

-- Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

-- Assumption:

-- There are no duplicates in the candidates table.
-- candidates Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- candidate_id	integer
-- skill	varchar
-- candidates Example Input:
-- candidate_id	skill
-- 123	Python
-- 123	Tableau
-- 123	PostgreSQL
-- 234	R
-- 234	PowerBI
-- 234	SQL Server
-- 345	Python
-- 345	Tableau
-- Example Output:
-- candidate_id
-- 123
-- Explanation
-- Candidate 123 is displayed because they have Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL skills. 345 isn't included in the output because they're missing one of the required skills: PostgreSQL.

-- Solution

SELECT      candidate_id

FROM        candidates

WHERE       skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')

GROUP BY    candidate_id

HAVING      COUNT(skill) = 3

ORDER BY    candidate_id
;
