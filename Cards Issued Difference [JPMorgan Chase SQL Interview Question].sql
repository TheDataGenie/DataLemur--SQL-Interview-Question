-- Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card, and to gain some context, you are analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.

-- Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in issued amount between the month with the most cards issued, and the least cards issued. Order the results according to the biggest difference.

-- monthly_cards_issued Table:

-- Column Name	Type
-- issue_month	integer
-- issue_year	integer
-- card_name	string
-- issued_amount	integer
-- monthly_cards_issued Example Input:

-- card_name	issued_amount	issue_month	issue_year

-- Chase Freedom Flex	55000	1	2021
-- Chase Freedom Flex	60000	2	2021
-- Chase Freedom Flex	65000	3	2021
-- Chase Freedom Flex	70000	4	2021
-- Chase Sapphire Reserve	170000	1	2021
-- Chase Sapphire Reserve	175000	2	2021
-- Chase Sapphire Reserve	180000	3	2021

-- Example Output:

-- card_name	difference
-- Chase Freedom Flex	15000
-- Chase Sapphire Reserve	10000

-- Explanation

-- Chase Freedom Flex's best month was 70k cards issued and the worst month was 55k cards, so the difference is 15k cards.

-- Chase Sapphire Reserve’s best month was 180k cards issued and the worst month was 170k cards, so the difference is 10k cards.

SELECT      card_name
          , (MAX(issued_amount) - MIN(issued_amount)) AS difference

FROM        monthly_cards_issued

GROUP BY    card_name

ORDER BY    difference DESC
;
